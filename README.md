# Oracle DB Front End

## Introduction

> As part of a project at the University of Minnesota Duluth, I was tasked with creating a web database application, so that a user could interact with a website and enter parameters to use a database instead of executing SQL queries. The project asked for a JSP/Servlet/JDBC implementation, but after confirming it was alright I decided to utilize purely Javascript web frameworks.

This Project was created with:
- AngularJS
- Angular Material
- Node.js
- Express.js
- node-oracledb

## Installation

> The only requirment is that you have node.js installed on your computer. Change directories to the bin folder and execute node on the www file. The default port is 3000. For testing on your local machine, you can visit localhost:3000.

> The database connect url is defined in `routes/index.js`
